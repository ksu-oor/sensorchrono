"""Live LSL liveness monitor — the staging gate's data source.

Resolves the expected streams by name on the LSL hub and, a few times a
second, measures each one's actual sample rate, largest inter-sample gap, and
channel count, comparing them to the contract's expectation. This is the
structural cure for the #1 historical failure (a stream silently missing or
under-rate in LabRecorder).

The verdict logic is a pure function (:func:`compute_stream_liveness`) so it is
unit-testable with no LSL; :class:`LslMonitor` is the threaded I/O wrapper that
feeds it (lazy ``pylsl`` import, so this module loads without liblsl).
