"""Preflight device scan — confirm each selected device actually responds
*before* staging, structurally killing the "wrong COM port / dead camera"
foot-guns.

Each check returns a :class:`CheckResult` (pass / warn / fail, required or
not). A required failure is a red-X blocker; a warning is a yellow-! the
operator can proceed past. All hardware libraries are imported lazily and a
missing library degrades the check to a warning (it can't be *proved* good,
but it shouldn't hard-block on the dev box). In dry-run the hardware checks are
skipped entirely.
