"""Process + fleet supervision.

Two pieces:

* :class:`BridgeProcess` — spawn one capture-bridge subprocess, watch its
  stdout for a per-bridge readiness line, and tear it down gracefully
  (``terminate`` → wait → ``kill``). Phase-2 real adapters build one of these
  with their specific command + readiness regex; the Shimmer adapter is the
  reason the readiness regex is per-bridge (its line has no "is live").

* :class:`Supervisor` — own a *fleet* of :class:`DeviceAdapter` and drive the
  whole-fleet lifecycle: launch all, wait for all to be ready under one shared
  deadline, tear all down. Adapter-agnostic, so it works identically for the
  simulated fleet (dry-run) and the real one.
