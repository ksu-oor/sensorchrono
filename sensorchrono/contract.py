"""Canonical LSL stream-name contract — the single source of truth.

Both tiers of this project reference LSL stream names as bare strings: the
real-time bridges (producers, repo root) and the analysis modules (consumers,
``analysis/``). Renaming a stream in a bridge silently breaks downstream
analysis, so the names live here *once* and everything imports them.

This module is intentionally dependency-free (stdlib only) so it can be
imported from anywhere — bridges, analysis, orchestration, GUI — without
pulling in ``pylsl``, Qt, or numpy.

Ground truth for the names was verified against the actual bridges and
``analysis/`` modules; they match producer↔consumer exactly today.
